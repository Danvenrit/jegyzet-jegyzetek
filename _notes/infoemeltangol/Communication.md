### Explanation of Communication
Communication is a kind of information exchange, which always takes place through a signalling system. Such a signalling system is the human language or binary system. It can happen between people, machines or anything that can understand each other
- we can define communication on some factors like:
	-  the number of communicators
		- interpersonal (between two people, e.g. discussion)
		- group communication (between a person and a group of people, e.g. written news or a lecture)
		- mass media (participants are not in the same time or place, e.g. advertisements, tv shows, news)
	- distance
		- direct (communication taking place in person)
		- indirect (participants are not in the same time or place, e.g. chatting or calling on a phone)
	- channels
		- verbal (Using spoken words)
		- non-verbal (Using gestures, body language or facial expressions)
	- mutuality
		- one-sided (i.e. the sender doing a monologue)
		- mutual (communication is going back and forth i.e.: a conversation)
	- relationship of the participants
		- equal (people talking with equal knowledge)
		- unequal (a teacher lecturing students)

### Communication model

![Model](https://i.imgur.com/Qhx6PLE.png) 

- In 1949, Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver published their communication model, which was later accepted as the basic communication structure of every human situation. Their aim was to make the transmission of messages over telephone wires as efficient as possible.
---
- Sender
	- The sender initiating the communication process.
- Encoding 
	- The sender converts the message into a suitable format for transmission, which the receiver can understand.
- Channel
	- The medium through which the message is transmitted. From the sender to the receiver, or receivers.
- Noise
	- The Interference or disruption affecting the transmission. It can affect it at any point of the process.
- Decoding
	- the Interpretation and extraction of the meaning from the received message.
- Receiver 
	- receiver of the message, from the sender.
---
- some examples of code systems:
	- ACII 
		- a widely used code system that assigns numerical values to characters, enabling computers to represent and process text using a 7 or 8-bit encoding scheme.
	- UNICODE
		- a comprehensive code system that provides a unique numeric code point for each character
	- Barcode
		- Are patterns of bars and spaces that encode numerical or alphanumeric data.
	- Morse Code
		- uses a combination of dots and dashes to represent letters, numbers and punctuations. Was developed for the telegraph

### Practical examples of the communication model
- email message between two people over the internet.
	- message
		- email message, from the sender to the receiver
	- sender
		- person A writing to person B
	- encoding
		- converting the message into the email format, including text, attachments and formating
	- channel
		- The internet and email servers used to transmit the email.
	- noise
		- Network congestion or interference that may cause delays or data corruption.
	- decoding
		- The recipient's email client software interpreting and displaying the received email.
	- receiver
		- Person B receiving the email message from person A
---
- Face-to-face conversation.
	- message
		- the topic of the discussion (verbal)
	- sender
		- the person speaking and expressing ideas in person.
	- encoding
		- converting thoughts into spoken words and non-verbal cues.
	- channel
		- the air as the medium for sound transmission.
	- noise
		- external distractions, such as loud noises or interruptions.
	- decoding
		- the listener understanding the spoken words and interpreting non-verbal cues.
	- receiver
		- the person listening to the other person speaking

### Code, as the device of information broadcasting
- code: The form of information that the encoder creates, which conforms to the channel standard, and which is interpretable by the decoder.
- information: Information carried by a set of signals that represents new knowledge for a system. Examples for informations: Breakin news, weather forecasts, traffic reports etc.
---
### Examples of channels
- Telephone lines
	- Physical wired connections, sending electrical signals.
- Radio waves: 
	- Electromagnetic waves transmit radio signals for broadcasting audio content
- Fiber optic cables
	- Fiber optic cables utilize thin strands of glass or plastic fibers to carry optical signals.
- Internet protocols (IP)
	- Network channels that allow data packets to be transmitted over the internet using various protocols, such as TCP/IP or UDP.
- Satellite communication
	- Communication channels that utilize satellites in space to transmit signals over long distances
- Air
	- Soundwawes, radiowaves, or light signals can be sent through it.

### Noise-canceling
- In the context of analog signals
	- **Amplification** 
		- Boosting the signal strength using amplifiers to minimize the impact of noise during transmission.
	- **Analog Filtering** 
		- Applying filters to filter out unwanted frequencies
	- **Shielding** Using shielding materials or enclosures to block external electromagnetic interferences
- in the context of digital signals
	- **Error Detection and Correction methods**
		- such as checksums, parity bit (check bit)
	- **Encryption**
		- encryption can secure the digital signal, and limit the chance of noise-induced distortions or tampering.
---
### Redundancy 
- refers to the intentional inclusion of additional information or redundant data in the signal. The purpose of incorporating redundancy is to provide error detection, error correction, or fault tolerance capabilities. Redundancy helps improve the reliability and integrity of the signal transmission and reception.
- pros of redundancy
	- **Error Detection and Correction**
	- **Fault Tolerance**
	- **Improved Reliability:**
- cons of redundancy
	- **Increased Bandwidth or Storage Requirements**
	- **Increased Complexity**
	- **Higher Transmission Overhead**

### Characterisation of today's communication technologies and tools and how they fit into the communication model
- visual (i.e.: smoke signals, storm warning, sign language, traffic lights, road signs)
- verbal (i.e.: education, lecture)
- written (i.e.: carrier pigeon, courier, leaflet, newspaper, post office)
- electronic (Morse-telegraph, telex, telephone, fax, computer networks, radio, TV, chat)
--- 
### Electronic communication and its tools 
- Electronic communication is the method by which various types of information are transmitted at the speed of light in the form of electrical signal. 
	- The original information (sound, light, mechanical signal...) must therefore always first be converted into electrical energy, which is then transmitted by wires, cables or electromagnetic waves in space, and the receiver converts the signal back into its original form.
- Types
	- Morse-telegraph, telex, telephone, fax, radio, TV
	- internet (WAN)
		- IRC (Internet Relay Chat), i.e. chat
		- Internet telephony - VoIP
		- email
		- telnet, SSH
		- FTP
		- WWW (world, wide, web)
		- Torrent (peer-to-peer)

### The impact of communication tools on our daily lives and on information searching
Communication tools have had and continue to have a big impact on our daily lives. As they evolved, the speed of information exchange accelerated.. If you look back just a few tens of years, if you needed information, you had to go to the library, or ask somebody who claimed to know something about your issue.
Nowadays, you have to reach into your pocket for your phone and just search for anything using your phone's browser. 
Without the development of communication tools, the modern world as we know it today would not exist. The emergence of the internet and its widespread use has also triggered changes within society. 
Today, anyone can find sites on the internet that match their interests like reading portals, online newspapers, blogs, or forums where they can talk to people with similar interests, express themselves anywhere, and with anyone in the world. With the spread of the Internet, it is now possible to watch movies, listen to music, and thousands of other ways to have fun, work with a computer. Communication technologies such as the telephone, email, fax, communication programs and chatting have changed the way we meet people and how we socialize. 
The possibilities are almost endless. 
The concept of virtual profile was born, the reality that anyone could impersonate anyone.  Today a lot of people couldn't even imagine a world without these gadgets and their amazing utility.

### The electronic forms of information searching
- Electronic information searching can be defined as searching something on our computer's or phones storage, or retrieving any kind of information through radio, tv, news, but mostly searching using the internet with the help of a browser (i.e.: google, Duckduckgo, Bing, yahoo, etc.).
- There are several ways to search, like using keywords, topics but if you search only using these, or even their combination you'll have way too many search results, mostly because of too much spam. So to combat this, browsers help you out by ranking websites to your search, on many factors like number of users, reputation, clicks, or even by paying the company, who owns the search engine to rank the website higher, for the sponsored time.
- today the emergence of language is also a viable option to search, for example trough paragraphs of text (from chatgpt 3), or even through the internet via chatgpt version 4.

### The existence and emergence of information systems in our daily lives (school, work, official business, leisure)
Modern technologies make our lives much easier. You only have to look at online shops (eBay, Amazon), electronic tax returns, online job applications, and a whole range of other official procedures. We can do all these online, in a much simpler and accessible way the caveat being you have a computer and internet connection at hand.
We can also download resources to help us with our studies, practice exercises and also organise our leisure time more easily for example by organising online activities such as studying for exams, booking accommodation, talk to friends about activities and a lot more.
The internet is also essential for work in many places (online conferences, online meetings, home office etc.)
