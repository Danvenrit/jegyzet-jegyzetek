### The meaning of data and information
- [Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information)
	- refers to data that has been processed, organized, or structured in a meaningful way to provide knowledge, understanding, or value. It is the result of collecting, analysing, and interpreting data to derive insights or to convey a message
- [Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data)
	- refers to raw, unprocessed facts, figures, measurements, or observations that are typically in the form of numbers, text, images, or other formats.
		- In information technology refers to 1 bit, which can have two states either 0 or 1, 1 byte = 8 bit, and from there it is 1024 KiB, MiB, GiB TiB, PiB etc.

    - Ancient Babylonian development of the base-60 numeral system (late 4000 BCE)
2.  **The Abacus and Medieval Calculation:**
    - The use of the abacus as a medieval calculation tool (prior to the Middle Ages)
3.  **Logarithms and the Slide Rule:**
    - John Napier's publication on logarithms and the invention of the slide rule (17th century)
4.  **Mechanical Calculators:**
    - Blaise Pascal's mechanical calculator (1642)
    - Leibniz's further development of Pascal's calculator (1700s)
5.  **automatic weaving machine, using punch cards:**
    - Joseph Marie Jacquard's invention of the automated punch card system for weaving (1805)
7.  **Boole and Boolean Algebra:**
    - George Boole's creation of Boolean algebra (mid-19th century)
8.  **Hollerith's Punch Card Processing:**
    - Herman Hollerith's use of punch cards for data processing, particularly for the U.S. census (1890)
10.  **Turing's Universal Computing Machine concept:**
    - Alan Turing's concept of the programmable Turing machine (1930)
    - Development of the first electronic computer, ENIAC (1943-46)
    - if a computer can do basic operations it can eventually do any kind of calculation given enough time
11.  **John Von Neumann and the EDVAC:**
    - The construction of the electronic computer EDVAC based on John von Neumann's principles (1946)
- **The history of the internet**
	- The development of the internet was driven by wars and military needs. During the Cold War, the United States Department of Defence (Pentagon) wanted to create a network system that could withstand a nuclear attack.
	- The task was assigned to the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). ARPA emphasized two principles for network security: decentralization and packet switching. The network had no central point, and each node was connected to multiple other nodes. Messages were divided into packets and could travel independently along different routes.
	- By the end of 1969, an experimental network was established among four universities, and more universities joined later. This became known as ARPANET.
	- As ARPANET grew in size, technical challenges became evident. In the mid-1970s, the TCP/IP protocol, which is still in use today, was developed to address these challenges.
	- In 1983, the military portion of ARPANET separated, and by the late 1980s, ARPANET gave way to the internet.
	- Another significant milestone was reached in 1992 when the World Wide Web, which provides a graphical interface for internet users, was developed.
- **Today**
	- In summary, the field of computer science and the internet is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world, with computational power doubling approximately every two years. However, there is a limit to how much transistors can be reduced in size, as dictated by the atomic scale (around 0.1 nanometres). Estimates suggest that within 10-15 years, this limit will be reached, requiring the development of new technologies, most likely contender today is quantum computing, but there are issues with creating perfect qubits, and retrieving data from qubits

### Generation of computers
-  GEN 1 (1940s-1950s)
	- Vacuum Tube Computers: The first generation of computers used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory. Examples include ENIAC and UNIVAC, EDVAC. They were large, expensive, and generated a lot of heat (mainly because they were essentially glorified lamps around 100 watts per tube.)
	- these tubes were basically larger then the palm of a persons hand.
-  GEN 2 (1950s-1960s)
	- Transistor Computers: Transistors replaced vacuum tubes, making computers smaller, faster, and more reliable. Magnetic core memory was introduced, improving storage capabilities. Examples include IBM 1401 and CDC 1604.
	- transistor size ranged from several centimetres to few millimetres to 
-  GEN 3 (1960s-1970s)
	- Integrated Circuit Computers: Integrated circuits (ICs) allowed multiple transistors and other components to be miniaturized and integrated onto a single chip. This led to smaller, more powerful, and more efficient computers. Examples include IBM System 360 and DEC PDP-11.
	- transistor size ranged from few millimetres to few hundred micrometres
-  GEN 4 (1970s-1980s)
	- Microprocessor Computers: The invention of microprocessors enabled entire central processing units (CPUs) to be integrated onto a single chip. This further reduced the size and cost of computers, making them accessible to individuals and businesses. Examples include IBM PC and Apple II.
	- transistor size ranged from tens of micrometres to a few micrometres 
-  GEN 5 (1980s-Present)
	- Artificial Intelligence and Parallel Processing: The fifth generation is characterized by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and parallel processing. These computers are designed to mimic human reasoning and handle complex tasks simultaneously. Examples include supercomputers like Cray-2 and modern AI-based systems.
	- transistor sizes are now well in the nanometres, and ever shrinking as of today 4 nano meter AMD processes are commercially available. And 3 nanometres processes are coming with the help of ever improving ASML-s lithography lasers.

### The improvement of peripherals
- INPUT
	- Initially, it didn't exist in its current form; data was entered through switches. Later, the teletypewriter emerged, replacing terminals, and the keyboard appeared, which was integrated into some machines. With the widespread use of PCs, the mouse/pointing device emerged. It initially existed in mechanical (ball) form, and later optical versions became popular. At first, there were only two buttons, but this continuously evolved. Alternative input devices for portable computers appeared (touchpad, Trackball), as well as scanners and their various forms, webcams, microphones, digital cameras.
		- Keyboard: number of keys; language layout; ergonomic keyboard

### The impact of information and communication tools on society
- communication:
	- at first: sounds, drawings, everything was told in person, and everything had to be memorized by hearing.
- appearance of writing
	- written text is recordable, and can be preserved
	- learning: because there is still large illiteracy rate, everything is read out load, and then noted by literate listeners.
- spreading of book printings, 
	- written record, books, discoveries, made independent learning available
- nowadays
	- modern (mass) communication devices
		- first telegraph, then radio, TV, telephone, internet
	- PC
		- initially an autonomous system
		- at first needed physical transfers of files via floppies
		- later smaller networks
		- companies recognize that information exposed to larger networks is of advertising value-> growing networks, eventually the internet
		- home office, online home work for students globalized world.
		
---
#### The impact of local area networks
- the internet has fundamentally changed communication 
	- 60 years ago: both people had to meet face to face.
	- 30 years ago: telephone booth, both people had to be at the predetermined telephone booth and predetermined time.
	- 10 years ago: mobile call makes quick, real time easy talks possible.
	- todays: 
		- chat, VoIP, etc. -> fast communication 
		- human connections have been less physical, and more virtualized 
		- Virtual profiles emerged 
		- very high online life especially among young demography.

	- who's data it is, freshness
- credibility, depends on: 
	- source (reliable, from experts)
	- history of source
	
---
##### Purpose of hoax, recognition, adverse effects and processing of hoax
- definition of hoax: scam, rumour
- in many cases, handling hoaxes consumes more resources than viruses
- spread: thanks to users naivety (e.g.: send this to 10 friends!)
- the goal of a hoax is usually to spread misinformation, about something
- but it can also be intended to cause harm for example: telling a old person via Facebook to type "format c:" into their windows terminal, to cause data loss for them, or to make them download or open a infected program to spread virus.
- how they work:
	- hoaxes work by making the information believable, and by filling the sentences with jargon, to make the person think they got the letter from a credible person.
- how to avoid hoax: 
	- you can avoid hoax, if you talk with specialized person, who knows something about the topic, and always check different sources. Also it is good to ask yourself is this scenario even logical?
	
---
##### Legal and illegal forms of obtaining and publishing information
- publication 
	- depends on the country, but usually it is illegal to sell, distribute and use illegally acquired copyrighted material, without the consent of the entity that owns the copyrighted material.
	- you should either get a written consent, or a contracted consent usually after paying money for it.
- getting information 
	- legal: questionnaires, interviews, contracts.
	- Illegal: without knowledge of the source (keylogger, data theft, eavesdropping, etc.) + piracy
	
---
##### Networks and computers,  information / data protection, security questions
- protection of computers
	- firewall
		- provides protection when connected to a network 
	- virus, spyware and malware protection 
		- protection against unwanted software, scans them, and quarantines or removes them if needed.
	- system updates: needed because old exploits are usually fixed, if uncovered.
- protection of networks
	- filtering infected letters, and spams.
	- controlling data traffic either locally or through ISP
	- ACL-s
- protection of information, and data
	- using appropriate protocols (https, SSH, FTPS) 
	- using encryption
	- password protection (e.g. compression) 
	- usage of bit locker
	
---
##### Threats endangering computers, information and how to defend yourself from exploits
- vulnerabilities
	- covert installation, trojan, special websites (router settings changed without our knowledge)
	- solution
		- virus protection, firewalls, safe browsers and mail programs, avoiding as much foreign programs as possible
- special type of exploit
	- social engineering
		- new form of attacks, it takes advantage of humans 
			- fishing attacks
		- solution
			- source checking, critical thinking, talking with a person who can double check the matter with you

- mental damage (family photos)
- financial damage (blueprints, patents, trade secrets) 

---
##### Redundancy in the storage of information 
- data loss protection
- RAID (hard disk mirroring)
- backup
- journaling
- other redundancy practices

---
### Definition of computer viruses and pests, their properties
 - a virus is a program, that was designed to harm an unsuspecting user's device 
- operation: when it runs, it attaches itself to programs and scripts which spreads as it runs or it works conditionally: e.g. it activates only after running x times 
- the severity of viruses range from a virus just showing adds on screen without permission, to playful messages, to stealing you computers data, to opening exploits in your system to even formatting your whole hard drive.
- source: flash drives, emails, foreign / cracked programs, unreliable websites, keylogging, backdoors in your system etc.

---
##### Changes in the way how your computer works which can be used to suspect viruses
- unreasonable increasement in the size of a file or unreasonable increase in used storage space
- appearance of foreign files
- runtime problems in programs
- network management slows down, indicates an error
- peripheral malfunction
- general machine slowdown (overloading the CPU, ram etc.)

---
##### Some examples of the historical development of viruses
- 1986 Sbrain
	- exploited floppy disks boot sector
- 1989 AIDS
	- first trojan virus ever made, it encrypted your data, and only gave you the encryption key when you paid up
- 1990 Chameleon (first polymorph)
	- the code changes with each infection -> hard to detect
	- polymorph definition --> it is a kind of virus, that changes its program code while running, while keeping its main algorithm intact enough, that it can deliver its planned attack. This is done to make it much harder to be detected by virus scanners.
- 2000 ILoveYou
	- the most successful virus of all time, it travelled around the world in 4 hours, it mainly excelled in exploiting people
- 2004 Bagle, Netsky, Sasser worms

---
##### Types of viruses, their effects
- file virus (oldest)
	- builds into executable files
	- only runs when the infected file is ran
	- conditional operation
		- destructive only when a condition is met (date reached, ran x times, etc.)
- boot virus
	- writes itself to the boot sector of the disk
- macro virus
	- writes itself into the document's command list
- trojan
	- a program disguised as something else, usually in another non malicious program
- worm
	- distributes copies of itself on the network 
	- consumes memory and bandwidth
- spyware
	- data collection, keylogging
	
---
##### Methods of defence
- infection of a clean computer
	- virus comes from an external source
	- solution
		- traffic control
		- inspection of data carriers 
		- boot sector checking
			- checks memory and running programs, notifies you if there is a problem 
		- firewall 
			- checks network traffic  and prohibits incoming data packets for which no request has been initiated
			- monitors outgoing data packets 
		- antivirus
			- information about viruses is stored in a ever-increasing database
			- checks programs, looks for virus characteristics (signature search) 
				- advantage
					- gives fast, reliable results 
				- disadvantage
					- it does not detect unknown viruses, as polymorphs are difficult to detect
					- must be updated regularly because of situations where the virus can activate itself 
			- heuristic search 
				- looks for specific commands or instructions that would not typically be found in an application.
				- advantage
					- it can detect unknown viruses
				- disadvantage 
					- slowness, false positives

---
##### How some popular viruses worked
- Sbrain
	- it worked by exploiting floppy disks, so it accessed a floppy disc boot sector
	- it was able to overwrite program codes and was able to copy itself to other computers
	- it was harmless, but it showed how easy it was to exploit
- Conflicker
	- It worked by exploiting a vulnerability in Windows's "server service", and was able to create backdoors in infected systems
	- this exploit was fixed in 2008
	- the second change to this virus worked by exploiting another vulnerability in "windows Autorun" function
	- even though the second one was also fixed, it was patched late, and around 7 million devices were infected with backdoors and these computers were connected to botnet networks.
- ILoveYou
	- was a computer worm that spread through email attachments
	- Email Attachment: The virus arrived in an email with the subject line "ILOVEYOU" and an attachment named "LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs."
	- it encouraged users to open the letter, with social engineering
	- when they downloaded the letter, and opened it, a Visual basic script file was launched
	- it then searched the users computer for specific files, like images, documents and valuable data, and replaced itself with those files
	- it then sent another email with the users email, to spread itself even more
	- it created huge damage mainly by creating a lot of damaged, corrupted files, and clogging email systems due to rapid growth in email traffic

	- license agreement
		- is an agreement which the user usually has to accept before using the given service
		- it specifies the permitted use, and its conditions
		- if someone wants to use a commercial application, he/she needs to buy a license, or contract which allows its use 
		- the software publisher can authorize someone to use it but to not be able to distribute it 
		- the buyer confirms the existence of the license with the license agreement (also with an invoice, or other contract) 
		- the license usually allows use on one machine, but depending on the contract could allow more, or just create other rules.

##### The definition and classification of software according to the user agreement.
- Definition
	- Software refers to a collection of programs, instructions, and data that are designed to perform specific tasks on a computer or other electronic devices. It encompasses both the applications (such as word processors, web browsers, and video games) and the operating systems that manage and control the hardware resources of a computer system.

		- usually includes documentation about how to use the software
	- shareware
		- free software, free access 
		- mostly incomplete software 
		- usually they can be used for a given time, after which payment will be needed for continued use, or it is a incomplete version of its paid version, but can be used for any time.

##### protection of software (technical and legal protection)
- legal protection 
	- it contains both copyright protection and software licensing regulation
	- contains the rules and policies for ensuring protection
	- usually before using the program users have to accept a long umbrella license, which contains all of this information
- technical protection
	- technical protection means prevention of unauthorized access and unauthorized redistribution
	- also other types of preventions where it prevents access like CD's or DVD's copy protection system, which either prevents it fully, or makes it so the program won't work after copying (SecuROM)
