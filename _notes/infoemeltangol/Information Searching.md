# Information searching

### Searching strategies in library systems and electronic libraries
- Basic algorithm of searching
	- 1. Simple search - single word search
		- A specific work can be searched for by any word or part of a word in an entry describing the document
		- ie: author, title, subject, publisher, ETO number, barcode etc.
	- 1. complex search - multiword search
		- In a complex search, you can search for documents based on several criteria. Search conditions are specified in several fields of the search form and are linked by logical operators (AND, OR, BUT NOT)
		- ie: where is it located (Kuria, xy library), document type, language, date
	- 1. Browse - List search
		- With a browser search, the reader or searcher does not get a specific result, but can search through the standardised classification data in the database.  You can find out, for example, what subject words are available, how many records contain the given subject word. Once you have found a term that matches or closely matches your idea, you can use the normal search to search for existing terms
##### **Catalog**
- systematic listing of works in the library
- can be a volume or tag catalog
	- systems:
		- alphabetical / serial
			- list them in alphabetical order by the first word of the author's name (or, in the absence of a name, the title)
			- contains the document's data
		- objective
			- documents are sorted by content or topic
			- profession catalog
			- keyword catalog
	- the books details are recorded on a catalog sheet

##### **Cross-references**
- most libraries use this
- cross-references occurs in several places, classified by several criteria
	- ordering rules
		- author's works are titled alphabetically
		- publications containing several works of the author are sorted alphabetically
		- the author appears as a co-author
		- the author is a contributor to other publications
		- literature regarding the author

##### Electronic catalogs, databases
- bigger or even joint catalogs
- easier searchability
- can be accesed with any computer if internet connection is available
- examples:
	- MOKKA (Magyar Országos Közös Katalógus)
	- ODR (Országos Dokumentumellátási Rendszer)

### Navigation in libraries
##### Free shelf system
- any document can be publicly viewed, and held
- everything has its place
- materials are listed in alphabetical order by the first word of the author's name (or, in the absence of a name, the title)
- Cutter number (combinated identification, that is a merge of the authors name, title, and other things )
- ETO-number for profession books

##### Searching for information
- execution
	- manually
		- card catalog
		- documents
		- with help of the librarian
	- computer
		- offline or online search
- search queries
	- conceptual
	- thematic or objective
	- individual search
	- chronological question
	- topographic or geographical question
- how can the librarian help
	- clarifies the issue
	- determines if you are in the right library
	- mark specialization
	- checking

### The algorithm of searching
- during the search (can be manually or with a computer), enter the value you are looking for and pick the one wich is the closest to you query.
- in case of a complicated search we use mathematical operations as manipulation to alter the scope and result of the search
---
### One and two factor searching
- one factor
	- performed in one operation
	- usually not accurate
		- exception if you enter an exact ID
- two factor
	- the returned set of results is narrowed down by the addition of more data (e.g. by year of publication, language, or document type)

### Searching on the internet, search engines
- the internet is a network of connected computers
- searching is needed for us to find the correct information, and we have tools to help us search like:
	- Google, Yahoo, Bing, Yandex, etc.

##### Searching strategies
- search engines use databases of indexed websites (by titles, keywords, description, sitemap, content etc.)
	- they monitor the web, find new websites
	- servers crawl the web and save the data about websites, and ranks them for given queries, by clossness to the given search, ranking by number of users and a lot more.
- thematic search
	- smaller data sets are more appropriate
		- by geographical location 
		- by multimedia type 
		- by document type
		- by specialization
	- not the most accurate system if we are looking for a specific thing
- keyword search
	- bigger data sets are more appropriate
		- we search with specific keywords and/or phrases
		- more accurate phrase -> more accurate result
	- clarifier characters can be used
		- "", accurate expression
		- +, must include
		- -, must NOT include
		- `*`, character replacement
		- ~, synonym
		- logical connections
			- AND, OR, NOT, NEAR

### Computer catalog, structure specifics
- each item in the data file is stored once
	- it can be retrieved based on several criteria, but it is enough to edit it in one location
		- with card catalogs you have to edit it in multiple locations
- searching the database can be done with multiple fields
- at the end of a search, the computer outputs the number of hits and descriptions of those hits
	- we also receive information about the document's availability
		- if not, the computer can show the right library where the document is available
- some catalogs are also available on the internet

### Some computer catalogs

- SZIRÉN
	- contains the data of the Magyar Nemzeti Bibliográfia 
		- it adapts to the needs of the users
		- always updated
	- the main menu has plenty of options
		- mostly used by librarians, computer scientists
		- readers should learn about its search functions
			- quick search
				- by topic, author, co-authors, co-authors activity, author quality
				- by the exact title or a part of the title
				- by serial title
				- by library site
				- by publishing date
				- by publisher
				- by inventory number
- MOKKA (Magyar Országos Közös Katalógus)
	- operator: OSZK & Mokka egyesület
	- each partner library can upload their own catalogs (after conversion based on rules)
	- duplications are removed (with a program) → each thesis included only once
	- if the document is located in more than one location, the record contains the code for each location
