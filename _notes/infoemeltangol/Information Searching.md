### Searching strategies in the library catalogue, electronic library, and online information retrieval
- **Library Catalogue:**  
    - Keyword Search
	    - Using relevant keywords to search for specific terms or topics in the catalogue's database.
	    
    - Subject Search
	    - Focusing the search on specific subject headings or categories to find related materials.
	    
    - Author Search
	    - Searching for works written by a particular author or contributor.
	    
    - Title Search
	    - Looking for materials based on their titles or specific words in the titles.
	    
- **Electronic Library:**
    - Metasearch
	    - Conducting simultaneous searches across multiple databases or resources for a wider scope of information.
    
    - Filtering Options
	    - Narrowing down search results using various criteria such as date, author, subject, etc.
    
    - Advanced Search
	    - Using advanced search features to refine the search, such as combining keywords, using Boolean operators, or specifying exact phrases.
    
    - Search by Resource Type
	    - Searching for materials based on specific formats like books, articles, videos, or other resource types.
	     
- **Online Information Retrieval**
    - Search Engines
	    - Utilizing popular search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo to search the web for information.
    
    - Keyword Optimization
	    - Formulating effective keyword queries to retrieve relevant results.
    
    - Advanced Search Operators
	    - Employing search operators like quotation marks for exact phrase searches, minus sign for excluding specific terms, or site search to limit results to a particular website.
    
    - Refining Search Results
	    - Using filters, date ranges, or additional search tools provided by the search engine to narrow down and customize search results.

- Basic algorithm of searching
	- 1. Simple search - single word search
		- A specific work can be searched for by any word or part of a word in an entry describing the document
		- i.e.: author, title, subject, publisher, ETO number, barcode etc.
	- 1. complex search - multiword search
		- In a complex search, you can search for documents based on several criteria. Search conditions are specified in several fields of the search form and are linked by logical operators (AND, OR, BUT NOT)
		- i.e.: where is it located (Kuria, xy library), document type, language, date
	- 1. Browse - List search
		- With a browser search, the reader or searcher does not get a specific result, but can search through the standardised classification data in the database.  You can find out, for example, what subject words are available, how many records contain the given subject word. Once you have found a term that matches or closely matches your idea, you can use the normal search to search for existing terms

### the algorithm of electronic search
1. Clearly define the information you are looking for and formulate the search query using relevant keywords, phrases, or terms.
    
2. Determine the appropriate search resources based on the context.
    
3. Access the chosen search interface.
    
4. Input the formulated search query into the search box.
    
5. Activate the search by submitting the query.
    
6. Receive a list of search results that match the query.
    
7. Assess the relevance and quality of the search results.
    
8. If necessary, refine the search query to improve the results

### algorithm of searching in general
1. Clarify your search goal
    
2. Identify relevant sources
    
3. Plan your search strategy in the given source
    
4. Gather information
    
5. Refine your search
    
6. Evaluate and select
    
7. Organize and document
    
8. Follow up if necessary

##### **Catalogue**
- systematic listing of works in the library

### how to use a catalogue
1. Determine your search objective
    
2. Locate the physical catalogue or catalogue system
    
3. Identify relevant categories or sections within the catalogue
    
4. Browse or flip through the catalogue to find relevant entries

##### **Cross-references**
- most libraries use this
- cross-references occurs in several places, classified by several criteria
	- ordering rules
		- author's works are titled alphabetically
		- publications containing several works of the author are sorted alphabetically
		- the author appears as a co-author
		- the author is a contributor to other publications
		- literature regarding the author

##### Electronic catalogues, databases
- bigger or even joint catalogues
- easier searchability
- can be accessed with most computer if internet connection is available
- examples:
	- MOKKA (Magyar Országos Közös Katalógus)
	- ODR (Országos Dokumentumellátási Rendszer)

### unique characteristics of electronic catalogues
- Accessibility
	- Computer catalogues are accessible online, allowing users to search for materials from anywhere with internet access.
	
- Advanced search capabilities
	- Computer catalogues offer advanced search options, allowing users to search by various criteria such as title, author, subject, keyword, or even specific fields within a record. This enables more precise and targeted searches, leading to more relevant results.
	
- Speed and efficiency
	- Computer catalogues provide faster search results compared to manual searching through physical catalogues.
	
- Additional information
	- Computer catalogues often provide additional information about materials mainly because there isn't any space constraints
	
- Integration with other systems
	- Computer catalogues can be integrated with other library systems, such as circulation systems, allowing users to check the availability and place holds or requests for materials directly from the catalog interface.
	
- Updates and notifications
	- Computer catalogues can be regularly updated to reflect new acquisitions, changes in availability, or any other relevant updates.

### One and two factor searching
- one factor
	- performed in one operation
	- usually not accurate
		- exception if you enter an exact ID
- two factor
	- the returned set of results is narrowed down by the addition of more data (e.g. by year of publication, language, or document type)

### Some computer catalogues

- SZIRÉN
	- contains the data of the Magyar Nemzeti Bibliográfia 
		- it adapts to the needs of the users
		- always updated
	- the main menu has plenty of options
		- mostly used by librarians, computer scientists
		- readers should learn about its search functions
			- quick search
				- by topic, author, co-authors, co-authors activity, author quality
				- by the exact title or a part of the title
				- by serial title
				- by library site
				- by publishing date
				- by publisher
				- by inventory number
- MOKKA (Magyar Országos Közös Katalógus)
	- operator: OSZK & Mokka egyesület
	- each partner library can upload their own catalogues (after conversion based on rules)
	- duplications are removed (with a program) → each thesis included only once
	- if the document is located in more than one location, the record contains the code for each location
