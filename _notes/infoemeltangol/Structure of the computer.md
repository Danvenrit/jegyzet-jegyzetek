### Neumann-principle (1946)
- The Neumann-principle was worked out in 1946 and is the basis for the ideal operation of a computer
- the five main principle: 
	- has to be completely electronical, and has to have a central control system 
	- has to process instructions one by one
	- has to use binary number system 
	- should store data and programs on internal memory and storage
	- has to be Turing complete
		- Turing complete ---> if a computers is universally Turing machine based, it can do basic mathematical operations, so given enough time, it can do basically any kind of calculations. All of todays computers are Turing complete as well.
		- First Neumann computer: EDVAC

### Neumann like computer structure
- a CPU has to have 
	- Control Unit (CU)
		- It controls all the CPU-s other parts, such that they are in sync, and can work together properly
	- Arithmetical and Logical Unit (ALU)
		- data is mainly processed here, it does all the calculations happening in a computer. (today though ALU-s are fully integrated into micro processor parts)
	- Register Block
		- it is the smallest capacity memory that is directly accessible by the CPU and has very low latency, and very fast read and write speeds. It feeds the CPU important data like instructions, storage address, or any kind of bit sequence
	- Flash Memory
		- in this context, flash memory is typically used for storing firmware, operating systems, and data in electronic devices. It serves as a rewritable storage medium that retains information even when the power is turned off.
- Memory
	- this is the primary storage used to hold instructions and data during program execution. It is typically volatile, meaning it loses its contents when power is turned off.
- Hard storage
	- It is used for long-term storage of data and programs. It is also non-volatile so it retains data even after power is cut.
- Peripherals (I/O)
	- creates a relationship between the user and computers such that the user can more easily use the computer

		- ALU - data processing, calculations, etc.
		- Register 
			- is the fastest kind of memory (32/64 bit)
			- is temporary memory for the CPU
			- extremely low latency 
		- Bus system 
			- is responsible for connecting the CPU to the operational memory and other components like peripheral, drives, etc.
			-  contains:
				-  a Bus: 
					- which is a connection between components or devices connected to a computer
				- a Bus controller
					- which is controlling information between the CPU and all kinds of components and devices.
			- bus types:
				- internal bus - connects internal components to the CPU
				- external bus - connects external devices to the CPU
				- parallel bus -  data is transported in several bits at a time
				- serial bus - data is transported one bit at a time
				- address bus - contains the location of different datas within the memory
				- data bus - transfers the data 
		- Cache 
			- small in capacity, but has extremely low latency, and is very fast
			- prefetches and feeds data to the CPU for processing.
		- Features: 
			- Clock speed (operation rate, Hz) 
			- Architecture 
				- 32/64 bit
				- arm/x86
			- Number of cores 
			- die size (in nano meters)

### Main peripherals and their characteristics
- Monitor
	- Standard video output
		- Size (inch)
		- Aspect ratio (ratio of the rows of pixels to the columns of pixels i.e.: 1080 : 1920 has a 16:9 aspect ratio)
		- Resolution (number of pixels - number of cols * rows)
		- Type 
			- CRT (Cathode Ray tube)
				-  A CRT monitor contains millions of tiny red, green, and blue phosphor dots that glow when struck by an electron beam that travels across the screen to create a visible image.
				- CRT display can have variable resolutions due it not having actual pixels
				- refresh rate of the display depends how fast the electron gun is and could be made higher by lowering the resolution
				- has to be warmed up before use (i.e.: the characteristic slow start-up with high pitched noises)
				- were very big and heavy due the tech needing a big ray gun and a thick glass block to work
				- had decent blacks
				- had great viewing angles
			- TFT (thin film transistor)
				-  utilizes an electrical charge that causes the liquid crystals to change their molecular structure creating different colours
				- usually has 7 layers sandwiched together
					- two polarizing filter
					- three colour filters (red, green, and blue)
					- two aligning filter 
					+ + backlight which is usually a strong white or blue coloured light
				-  has poor contrast ratio
				- easy and cheap to mass produce
				- technology is small and flat
				- had poor black levels and contrast
				- not very good viewing angles
			- LCD (Liquid crystal display)
				- works similarly as TFT displays, i.e.: layered with polarizing and aligning filters, but instead of colour filters it uses liquid crystals to produce colour, which are changed by controlling the voltages, and illuminated by backlight.
				- has decent black levels
				- actually pixels are used
				- refresh rate depends how fast the crystals can react to the change, which is given by the quality of the crystals
			- Plasma
				- uses small cells containing plasma, and ionized gases that respond to electric fields. The electric charge is then intersected with the gas and the plasma, thus changing the color in a very response, by the gas letting the plasma be stimulated in way it produces the desired colored lights.
				- had deeper blacks then other displays in it's prime time
				- uses a lot of power (a 50 inch plasma display could draw around 400 watts, which changes quite a bit depending on the brightness required for the scenes)
				- has very fast response time, and refreshrate
				- has better viewing angles than LCD 
				- are quite brighter than LCD
				- the plasma inside the display was very hot could even reach 1200 degrees, ie: the high power draw, and hot device
			- LED (light emitting diodes) display
				- uses arays of LEDs as pixels
					- each led pixel has three diodes, each for red green and blue
					- also needs a backlight 
					- has good brightness, and contrast
					- very efficient, uses less power than traditional displays

		- CDR
			- Compact Disc-Recordable
			- it is a type of CD that allows users to write data onto it, but only once.
			- these come empty, meaning no data has been burned on it yet, but you can fill it up yourself, so you can put you digital data on it like songs, videos, photos etc.
			- These also boasted around 650-700 megabytes of capacity
		- CDRW
			- Compact Disc-Rewriteable
			- it is basically the same thing as CDR, but you can burn, delete, and reburn data multiple times.
			- they were still around 650-700 megabytes
			- they had a rewrite cycle ranging from 1,000 to 1,000,000 cycles depending on the quality of the CDRW
		- DVD 
			- Digital Versatile Disc
			- they are also readable, and writeable multiple times
			- though they are now coming at much larger capacities 
			- there were different types for example:
				- DVD-5 single layer which had a capacity of 4.7 GB
				- DVD-9 dual layer which had a capacity of 8.5 GB
				- DVD-18 dual-sided, dual layer, which had a total of 17GB, combining both sides
		- BD
			- Blu-Ray Disc - 25 GB or 50 GB
			- but today there are even triple, and quadruple layered ones, which can exceed 100GB ad 128GB respectively

	- Host - terminal
		- The host performs all tasks, the terminal just issues them
	- Peer-to-Peer
		- All machines are servers and workstations in one
---
- ### Network topologies
	- Bus (looks a lot like a bus's row, and each seat being a computer on the left and right)
		- Each PC is connected to a single central cable
	- Ring (basically a circle of computers)
		- The transportation medium forms a circle
		- Data packet travels around until it reaches the receiving PC
		- No problem in the event of a single break
		- No central unit
		- Double ring equals higher reliability
	- Star (has a centre point which is the switch, and each computer is a connection node to the central unit)
		- Central unit (HUB)
			- Everything passes through it
		- In the event of a line break only one machine is disconnected from the network
		- Efficient but expensive
	- Tree (looks like a family tree going from top and multiplying to the bottom)
