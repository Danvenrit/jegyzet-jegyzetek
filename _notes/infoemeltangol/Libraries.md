### The role of the Universal Decimal Classification in the establishment of library classification.
- One of the fundamental tasks of libraries is to provide and make information accessible, therefore it is necessary to classify library documents based on a unified organizing principle. 

- This ensures efficient searchability. One such organizing principle for documents can be the Universal Decimal Classification , abbreviated as UDC or call number (ETO in Hungarian). 

- The development of the UDC  system began in the late 19th century, based on the classification system devised by American librarian Melvil Dewey.

- It started being used in 1905 and was introduced in Hungary in 1912.

- The ETC system divides books into 10 main classes, in which there are 10 subclasses, and further divided into 10 sub-subclasses. If needed, the subclasses can be further expanded to ensure precise placement of every work. This means that more specific documents have longer UDC numbers associated with them.
